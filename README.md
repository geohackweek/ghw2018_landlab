# Project Title: Advanced Geo-spatial-temporal research software curriculum: Developing Landlab Modules to teach open source methods

[Paragraph describing the need and benefits to open source research software education in earth sciences]

Application Example and Motivation
[Landlab group on HydroShare using CI to train new students on a science domain specidfic modeling framework - How would we do that in other domains? 

Sample Application and Rubric
[Rose - Georgia Tech example - EdX; IDE for Python Enthought;  Decribe rubric as compared to online tutorials e.g. ESRI certificated, CUAHSI Virtual Classroom]

Specific Questions (breaking up of the project task)
The project contains two main parts: designing the framework for new modules and development of individual modules 

## 1. The Framework
The repository contains curriculum developed for geo-spatio-temporal analysis using open source research software.

### Start to Finish Tutorial building for Geo-spatio-temporal education and research
We are developing a framework for research software development that applies to a range of examples usable in the classroom. 

### Common Workflow Tools

_Github_  - describe why, how

_HydroShare 

_Landlab_

_JupyterNotebooks_

_UserExperience_

_Formal Publication_

_Distribution Channel Strategies_

_Component based software design_

_Contribute to an Open Source Project_

## 2. Modules
Each modules uses common workflow tools that we share developing, using and teaching each other.  Each module uses existing open source code and explores advancing this code with at least one new component.
